# VESPA Category Persistence Fix

## Issue
The VESPA category field for activities was not persisting because:
1. The Supabase `milestones` table was missing the `vespa_category` column
2. The app.js wasn't integrated with Supabase to save/load data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Migration
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add vespa_category column to milestones table
ALTER TABLE milestones 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS vespa_category TEXT;

-- Also add attachments column while we're at it
ALTER TABLE milestones 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS attachments TEXT[];

-- Update the column comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN milestones.vespa_category IS 'VESPA category for activities: VISION, EFFORT, SYSTEMS, PRACTICE, or ATTITUDE';
COMMENT ON COLUMN milestones.attachments IS 'Array of file URLs or attachment descriptions';
```

### 2. App Integration
The app.js has been updated to:
- Initialize Supabase client when config is available
- Save milestones to both localStorage and Supabase
- Load milestones from Supabase first, falling back to localStorage
- Properly handle the `vespaCategory` and `attachments` fields

### 3. Configuration
Make sure your `config.local.js` file exists with your Supabase credentials:

```javascript
// config.local.js
window.localConfig = {
    supabase: {
        url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
        anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'
    }
};
```

## Testing
1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase
2. Refresh the timeline app
3. Edit a VESPA activity and set its category
4. Save the milestone
5. Refresh the page - the category should persist

## Features Now Working
- ✅ VESPA categories save to Supabase
- ✅ Attachments save to Supabase
- ✅ Automatic sync between localStorage and Supabase
- ✅ Offline support (falls back to localStorage)
- ✅ All milestone data properly synced

## Note
The app will work in localStorage-only mode if Supabase is not configured, ensuring backwards compatibility.
