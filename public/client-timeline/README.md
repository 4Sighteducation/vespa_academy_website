## Sharing with Clients

### Option 1: Direct Link Sharing (Simplest)
1. Select your client in the tool
2. Copy the URL from your browser (it will include `?client=client-xxxxx`)
3. Share this link with your client
4. **Note**: Client will have access to the tool interface (can modify data)

### Option 2: Hosted Solution (Recommended)
1. **Upload to Web Server**: Host the tool on your website (e.g., `timeline.vespa.academy`)
2. **Password Protection**: Add `.htaccess` file for basic authentication
3. **Share Credentials**: Provide clients with URL and password

### Option 3: Export-Only Sharing (Most Secure)
1. Use the PDF export for read-only sharing
2. Generate CSV for clients who need the raw data
3. No risk of accidental modifications

### Option 4: Subdomain per Client (Professional)
- Create subdomains like `clientname.timeline.vespa.academy`
- Each client gets their own isolated instance
- Requires more technical setup but provides best experience

## Exporting Data

### PDF Export
- Generates a professional PDF report
- Includes client information and milestone summary
- Perfect for client meetings and documentation

### CSV Export
- Creates a spreadsheet-compatible file
- Contains all milestone data in tabular format
- Ideal for detailed analysis and record-keeping

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Regular Updates**: Update milestone progress weekly to maintain accurate timelines
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Add comprehensive descriptions to help with future reference
3. **Deliverables Tracking**: List all key deliverables for each milestone
4. **Client Reviews**: Use the visual timeline during client meetings for better engagement
5. **Export Regularly**: Generate PDF/CSV exports for record-keeping and sharing

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Local storage must be enabled for data persistence

### Data Management
- Each client's data is stored separately
- Client selection is maintained via URL parameters
- Data can be backed up by exporting to CSV

### Customization
The tool uses CSS variables for easy color customization:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #102f62;    /* VESPA brand blue */
    --secondary-color: #1e88e5;   /* Accent blue */
    --accent-color: #4caf50;      /* Success green */
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My data disappeared**
A: Check if you're using the same browser and haven't cleared local storage

**Q: Timeline looks compressed**
A: Use the zoom controls to adjust the scale

**Q: Can't export PDF**
A: Ensure pop-ups are allowed for the export functionality

**Q: How do I delete a client?**
A: Click the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to the client name, then click the "Delete Client" button. This will permanently remove the client and all associated timeline data.
