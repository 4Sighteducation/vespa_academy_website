				<p class="text-lg text-gray-300">
					The VESPA framework was born from decades of hands-on experience in the classroom. We saw that success wasn't just about innate ability; it was about mindset and method. We wanted to create a simple, powerful tool that would allow any teacher, in any school, to identify and develop the non-cognitive skills that make the biggest difference. Today, VESPA is used by hundreds of schools worldwide, and we are proud to have co-authored "The A Level Mindset," "The GCSE Mindset," and "The VESPA Handbook" to support our global community of educators.
