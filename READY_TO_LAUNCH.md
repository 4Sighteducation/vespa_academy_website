## 📋 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### 1️⃣ Set Environment Variables in Vercel (5 mins)
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add the SendGrid variables (see ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)
- These are needed for the contact form and questionnaire to work

### 2️⃣ Test Your Preview Site (10 mins)
- Visit your Vercel preview URL (should be something like `vespa-academy-new.vercel.app`)
- Test key functionality:
  - ✓ Homepage loads
  - ✓ Navigation works
  - ✓ Contact form (after env vars are set)
  - ✓ Questionnaire (after env vars are set)

### 3️⃣ Add Domain to Vercel (2 mins)
- In Vercel: Settings → Domains
- Add both: `vespa.academy` and `www.vespa.academy`
- Copy the DNS records Vercel shows you

### 4️⃣ Update DNS at Siteground (5 mins)
- **IMPORTANT**: Screenshot your current DNS first!
- Only change A and CNAME records
- Do NOT touch MX records (email)
- Follow the guide in SIMPLE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

### 5️⃣ Wait & Verify (5-30 mins)
- DNS propagation usually takes 5-30 minutes
