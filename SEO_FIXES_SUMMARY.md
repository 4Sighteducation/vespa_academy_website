# 🔍 SEO Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Meta Language Tag** 
   - Added `<meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en-GB" />` to Layout.astro
   - This tells search engines the site is in British English

2. **Title Length**
   - Updated About page title to be more descriptive
   - From: "About Us | VESPA Academy"
   - To: "About VESPA Academy | Evidence-Based Non-Cognitive Skills Development"

## 📋 Remaining SEO Recommendations

### 1. **Title Tags** (Quick Fixes)
Update these pages with longer, more descriptive titles:
```
- Pricing → "VESPA Academy Pricing | Flexible Plans for Schools & Colleges"
- Contact → "Contact VESPA Academy | Get Started with Non-Cognitive Skills Training"
- Solutions → "VESPA Solutions | Coaching Portal & Resource Library for Schools"
- Model → "The VESPA Model | Evidence-Based Framework for Student Success"

```

### 2. **Alt Attributes for Images**

- The issue might be on a specific page or modal
- Ensure each page has exactly one H1 tag

### 4. **Additional SEO Best Practices**
- ✅ Sitemap submitted
- ✅ Robots.txt created
- ✅ Meta descriptions present
- Consider adding structured data (JSON-LD) for better rich snippets
- Add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
